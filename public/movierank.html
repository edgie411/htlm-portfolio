<h1>The Best Movies According to Edgar</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Ratatouille</h3>
<p>A great animated movie that teaches you that your background should not inherently define what you can do.</p>
<h3>Yes Man</h3>
<p>Really funny movie about a guy (played by Jim Carrey) that chooses to say yes to every single oppotunity that comes his way.</p>
<h3>Star Wars Episode IV: The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>I always have a blast watching this movie, and the twist is a classic.</p>
