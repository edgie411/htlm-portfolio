<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I like to play on my nintendo switch for a decent amount of time daily. I've always enjoyed playing video games 
  ever since I was little. It's pretty fun. I like to listen to a lot of music. I like Grunge, CLassical, and Rock music.
  My favorite band is The Beattles.</p>

<p>I work as a security officer at a construction site. It's a nice job, although the only thing I can do is to observe and 
  report. The title of "security officer" sounds fancy,
   so I usually never empashize to impress my peers (as was suggested by a friend).

<p>I've always enjoyed the idea of working in some for of computer space, 
  so I'm excited to keep on learning more in the proccess of becoming a web developer</p>
